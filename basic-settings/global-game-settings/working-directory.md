When you initially use HMCL-PE, it does not start version isolation.

Version isolation is great feature, it allows you to install multiple minecraft versions in one .minecraft folder and they don't affect each other, which solves a lot of unnecessary troubles.

When you use version isolation, each of your minecraft version folders will be in `HMCLPE/.minecraft/versions/[your-version-name]`

If you add mods to the mods folder in the main folder, they will not be loaded.
