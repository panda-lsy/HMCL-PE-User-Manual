# Go,Find a server

## Preparation

When you find another server, you need to make sure of the following:

* [ ] If the server is a **vanilla server**, you need to confirm your minecraft version
* [ ] If the server is a **modded server**, you need to seek the corresponding client
* [ ] If you don't have a Microsoft account, you may not be able to log in to most servers

{% hint style="info" %}
The online settings of the server can be viewed in the description of the server or set in the server.properties file of the server.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] You need to know the IP address of the server and fill it into the multiplayer

{% hint style="info" %}
by clicking the Multiplayer button, clicking the ADD SERVER button, clicking the Input button of HMCL-PE in the input box, using the input software to copy the IP address and add the server.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] If the server requires whitelisting, you need to go and request a whitelist.

## Connect to the server

You need to ask the server admin for serverIP,then add a server to the multiplayer game sector of the game.

The name of the server is arbitrarily, and the server address is filled in the IP:port(like wt.huafia.win:39980) provided by the server admin, and the server can be added.
