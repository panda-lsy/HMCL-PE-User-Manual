# Asking for Help

## Preparation

Before you can rule out problems caused by mods or games, you need to consider that there is a problem with the Java VM driver (launcher) or hardware.

### _**Repeat, the location of your minecraft folder. The following will be replaced with "\[minecraft-version]":**_

When you use version isolation, each of your minecraft version folders will be in `HMCLPE/.minecraft/versions/[your-version-name]`

If not_**,**_your minecraft version folders will be in

`HMCLPE/.minecraft`

### **Before seeking help, you need to have the following documents ready:**

* [ ] latest.log

Location:_**`[minecraft-version]/logs/latest.log`**_

* [ ] the newest crash report()

Location:_**`[minecraft-version]/crash-reports`**_

{% hint style="info" %}
Crash reports are generally named as

crash-year-month-day\_hour.min.second-type.txt

The types include client (client side) and server (server side), client side is the game launched directly with a launcher (such as HMCL-PE), server side is the server launched with the opening service file.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] What you did before the crash, etc., some information about your playtime

Location:_**`Your Brain`**_

### Get help at Discord

You can upload your files in Discord's "Support:#on-game-crash-report."

You can also send files directly to #General for help. There are more people online there, but not all of them may be able to answer your questions.

#### This is a tutorial from the official Discord:
