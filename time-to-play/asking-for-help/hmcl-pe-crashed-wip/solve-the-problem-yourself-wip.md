> Guys I know how to fix a error bug when open hellolauncher, when I start the game I left the game because I forgot to do something with my keyboard, when I left the game has not loaded yet, and when I click hellolauncher it says an error has occured.... If someone has the same problem as me, try doing these steps :

1. Go to your File Manager(Or install a file manager app like Zarchiver in google play)
2. Find HMCLPE file then click on it
3. Move all the files to where you want to put(MUST REMEMBER THE PLACE YOU PUT ALL THE FILES)
4. Try open the launcher to check if it is crashing or not
5. Go to the place you put all the HMCLPE files, then move all the HMCLPE files to the HMCLPE file.

REMEMBER : Using **"Cut"** option is wayyyy faster than **"Copy"**. Using "Copy" options then paste it to the other files will take a longgg time to load, make sure you use "cut" option in order to fix this If this one does not work for you, try to use your brain to find out another method.
{% endhint %}
